// Accessing Structure Members :-
//Sample Code

#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
 
using namespace std;

   char  title[50];
   char  author[50];
   char  subject[100];
   int   book_id;

   // book 1 specification
   strcpy( Book1.title, "BumBum");
   strcpy( Book1.author, "Apurva Shrivastava"); 
   strcpy( Book1.subject, "How to be the best");
   Book1.book_id = 143;

   // book 2 specification

   // Print Book1 info
   cout << "Book 1 title : " << Book1.title <<endl;
   cout << "Book 1 author : " << Book1.author <<endl;
   cout << "Book 1 subject : " << Book1.subject <<endl;
   cout << "Book 1 id : " << Book1.book_id <<endl;

   // Print Book2 info
   cout << "Book 2 title : " << Book2.title <<endl;
   cout << "Book 2 author : " << Book2.author <<endl;
   cout << "Book 2 subject : " << Book2.subject <<endl;
   cout << "Book 2 id : " << Book2.book_id <<endl;

   return 0;
}

//You can also pass them as a function arguement
/*
e.g)
The same printing statement i can write as a function and pass the structure as an arguement.

// This function accept pointer to structure as parameter.
void printBook( struct Books *book ) {
   cout << "Book title : " << book->title <<endl;
   cout << "Book author : " << book->author <<endl;
   cout << "Book subject : " << book->subject <<endl;
   cout << "Book id : " << book->book_id <<endl;
}


to call this function, we need to call the function in the following way:-
printBook( &Book1 )
